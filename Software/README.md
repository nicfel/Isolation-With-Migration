# How to run AIM

While AIM is a Beast package, it currently cannot be run using BEAST2 directly. Instead the here provided jar file AIM.jar is a compiled version of BEAST2 that includes AIM and can be run as:

~~~
java -jar AIM.jar example.xml
~~~

The package will be made available via the BEUAti package manager at a later stage
